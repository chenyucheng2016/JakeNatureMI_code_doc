        Summary line.
    
        recognize the action label from a stream of frames. This method is used in both frame and event based approaches.
    
        Parameters:
        ------------
        frame: the current rgb frame
        cov_mei: the covariance of motion energy images
        cov_mhi: the covariance of motion history images
        mean_mei_hu: the mean of motion energy images's hu moments
        mean_mhi_hu: the mean of motion history images's hu moments
        rgb_images: the stream of rgb images to compute MEI and MHI
        scores_cache: the manhattan distance between traning distribution and test sample
        is_frames: a boolean variable specifying if the MEI and MHI are computed for rgb frames or events
        use_probability: a boolean variable specifying if a probability is used for action recognition result
    
        Returns:
        ------------
        label: action classification label
        frame: processed frame
