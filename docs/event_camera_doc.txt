    Summary line.

    This is the simulation of the event camera from grayscale images

    Parameters:
    ------------
    cur_gray: current grayscale image at time cur_t
    cur_t: more recent time, cur_t > prev_t
    prev_gray: previous grayscale image at time prev_t
    prev_t: previous time, prev_t < cur_t
    prev_sensor_val: sensor val at the previous frame

    Returns:
    ------------
    4xN array of events, number of events as an array the size of the image, and the final sensor value
